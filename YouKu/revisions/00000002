son of VideoEdit

Now that YouTube is blocked, I may try http://www.youku.com instead

what I found in ubuntu is all the videos are also cached in /tmp/

which means I may also be able to edit it

{{{
$ffmpeg -i theyoukuvideo.flv myaudio.mp3
}}}
failed

but ubuntu built-in RhythmBox player can play it directly, I can really happy with that
since YouKu also has lots of EnglishStudy resources, I can download these videos can have a repo for them.
