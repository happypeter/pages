so I first started here
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Git
as I am in ubuntu 9.04 and using emacs22, I alredy has the basic git support. 
{{{

    * vc-git.el – a VersionControl backend (This is part of Emacs since version 22.2 (released in March 2008); see also [1] for experimental hacks by ttn.)

Clarification here: Git, as in “Git support”, IS included in emacs 22 and 23. Certainly loading the above caused issues with Emacs 23.0. 
}}}
and form the above, I got a link to 
http://github.com/tsgates/git-emacs
which mostly works, try ''M-x'' to see the new commands provided.
e.g ''gitk'' ''git-config-init'' and a lot others...
