=== About this doc ===

Software needs its own doc. Linux Kernel uses docbook, my Project Tinylion uses wiki, all nice. But you need to install realted software to write or read these things, so I decide to use html format for this doc, since all computers have browers, so everybody can read it.

Everything shall be kept as easy as possible, I do not use CSS, I will use bluefish to edit my pages, but I will keep the format simple enough to gurantee my own freedom to modify the docs without bluefish
