 1.First I install the following packages(using apt-get install xxx):

 1. xsltproc (the XSL Transformations Processor)
 1. docbook-xsl (stylesheets for HTML, XHTML, HTML Help and others)
 1. docbook-defguide (The Definitive Guide to DocBook - recommended)


 1. then the file test.xml and the following command

  {{{

 xsltproc -o test.html /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/xhtml/docbook.xsl test.xml

  }}}
 1. the use of Makefile is easy

 1. now I want to use fop to generate PDF file, but fop is java-based, so I need to install java first
  {{{
   $apt-get install sun-java6-bin
  }}}
   well, fop is not working!
