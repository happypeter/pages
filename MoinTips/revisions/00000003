 * Why I see conflicts even I use just 2 secs to finish the page editing ?
A: when you finish the editing, press save, then you want to edit more, you should not use firefox ''goback''
you should click 'edit this page' again

=== indention ===
when you use 
{{{
  1.xxx
 --{
 hello
 --}        NOTE: --} == }}}
  1.xxx
}}}

abd it will show up like this
 1.xxx
{{{
hello
}}}
 1.xxx

and this is obvious not what we want, all the solution is a proceeding whitespace in lines between ''1.''
