=== what to use? ===

==== moin defect ====
now i know EmacsUse, so as note-taking systerm moinmoin seems very defective:

 * even the moin-mode works perfectly, I still need to use mouse to invoke emacs
 * basic navigation is kind of OK, but if it is all done in text-mode, navigation can be faster
 * so now I perfer to do thing within the frame of emacs, which means faster navigation, faster editing
 * faster everything and awesomely many new fethers available through all kinds of mode and modes bonding
 * but I need to gurantee muse format can be nicely trasfromed into, at least, html, 
 * and it will be wonderful if other formats, like pdf docbook and moinmoin mediawiki ...
==== EmacsMuse defect ====
 * the code highlight is not available, while in text mode, and not so satisfying even in html format


 * navigation in text mode is fast
 * easy to pushlish a whole dir, which is very much a advantage over moin
 * this is a great thing to have
