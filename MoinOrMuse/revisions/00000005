=== what to use? ===

==== moin defect ====
now i know EmacsUse, so as note-taking systerm moinmoin seems very defective:

 * even the ''moin-mode.el'' works perfectly, I still need to use mouse to invoke emacs
 * basic navigation is kind of OK, but if it is all done in text-mode, navigation can be faster
 * so now I prefer to do thing within the frame of emacs, which means faster navigation, faster editing
 * faster everything and awesomely many new feathers available through all kinds of mode and modes bonding
 * but I need to garentee muse format can be nicely transfromed into, at least, html, 
 * and it will be wonderful if other formats, like pdf docbook and moinmoin mediawiki ...
==== EmacsMuse Advantage ====
 * the code highlight is not available, while in text mode, and not so satisfying even in html format
 A: actually this can easily achieve by changing ''pre.example'' filed in the ''.css'' file, see StyleSheet
 * navigation in text mode is fast
 * easy to pushlish a whole dir, which is very much a advantage over moin
 * this is a great thing to have
