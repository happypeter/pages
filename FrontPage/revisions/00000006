Below is about moin and wiki, built-in pages

What is this wiki about?

Interesting starting points:

 * RecentChanges: see where people are currently working
 * WikiSandBox: feel free to change this page and experiment with editing
 * FindPage: search or browse the database in various ways
 * HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax: quick access to wiki markup
 * SiteNavigation: get an overview over this site and what it contains

== How to use this site ==
A Wiki is a collaborative site, anyone can contribute and share:

 * Edit any page by pressing '''<<GetText(Edit)>>''' at the top or the bottom of the page
 * Create a link to another page with joined capitalized words (like WikiSandBox) or with {{{[[words in brackets]]}}}
 * Search for page titles or text within pages using the search box at the top of any page
 * See HelpForBeginners to get you going, HelpContents for all help pages.
 * For customizing MoinMoin's language support see HelpOnLanguages.
