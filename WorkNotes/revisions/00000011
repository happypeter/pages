== tips ==
 * NOTE:
   SDS will fail to readout package info if you have format error in spec file,
   even it is a missing '*' in the changlog

 * SDS can change Bugzilla info automaticlly
  1. change status: received->fixed
  1. sent a comment to bugzilla

 * choose Current<->mantaivence
    check Bugzilla->type
 * every time I apply a patch, I need to change spec file of my package
  1. release number must be changed
  1. add changelog

Hi Developers,

For beta4 release, I don't run the script to change the status to
INTEGRATED.
Please do it by yourself after you confirmed that CD includes your fix.
This has to be completed by 05/25.

Thank you,
-Jun

== NOTE ==

when Jun apprival my IP, I need to login SDS  to change it status to "closed".
And after the svn merge, I need close the bugs and check if the change is really integrated in the new ISO, but how?
ANSWER:Wait for the Email from Jun. Check the number "?" in "axtu...-?AX".

 * when you change the IP
  1. check file again to regenerate spec.diff
  1. add postfix to attached img file(like .png)

 * be sure to build the package brfore sending IP
note the name "axtu" or "axtu-authen-client" in
{{{
$sudo  /project/bin/axbldpkg -j Quartet-sp2  -V 3.0  -w ~/sds/ -t /home/peter/tmp/    axtu

on romi 
{{{

[peter@romi axtu]$ pwd
/home/peter/sds/packages/axtu
}}}
then 
 1. change spec
 1. change source code
 1. choose MT or CurrentDev in sds
 1. compile             
== Axtu Working Copy ==
How to checkout my own working copy

 1. login to rumi

 1. export SR=svn+ssh://peter@10.1.0.96/SDSrepo/trunk/packages/
    
    I already write it into romi;~/.bash_profile

 1. cd romi:/home/peter/sds/packages/

 1. svn co ''$SR/axtu/''  never change the structure, otherwise SDS can not find the code

 1. svn co ''$SR/VERMAP-DIR''

 1. svn co svn+ssh://peter@10.1.0.96/SDSrepo/trunk/comps

    ''romi: /project/bin/axbldpkg'' is the shell script make your source code into a rpm package

 * axtu repo here, but I am not sure if it is the main one???NO

== They way I work ==
go the axtu-debug/ and see what a mess there!!!
I need rules to devide all stuff here into distingushed parts, and yet well keep their connection.

too much disorgnized contents, why is this?

 1. I hate bug-reports, they are always misleading and useless, but here I am now forced to work this way, so I need to mv someaxtu-debug content into bugzilla discussion, and backup my own bugs, and all the sds diff for each IP I sent. How comes I need to backupbugzilla and sds? it's the work of the company, but those guys are not smart enough to keep my data safe.
 1. biggest trouble is from sds&svn, I hate them with all my passion. I can not wirte commit log, how rediculous! But anyway I have git now, so big part of axtu-debug can go into git log and source code comments. comments are really important for me, but I won't commit them into svn. My git repo will be the final authrity for axtu development
 1. I really need to change the way I take debug notes, otherwise things will get undercontrol getting bigger.

>>> some conclutions are really useful for later development, I will copy(maybe mv is better, since it is always stupid to maintain two copy of the same thing) it to doc-axtu/, such as HOW_AXTU_USE_AK and AXTU_GUI_WORK_FLOW, and this also means we do not need peki/study/axtu/ anymore.

{{{
Hi All,

I think some of you already know about this.
But let me send this out for confirmation and for new developer.

1. When a bug assigned to you and you started to work on it.
   You have to change the status of bug to 'RECEIVED'.
   Then other people can know you are investigating the bug.
   And SDS cannot change its status to FIXED when IP has been closed.

2. Send IP.
   SDS will change the status of bug to FIXED when you closed IP.
   You have to be sure you have changed the status to RECEIVED before
   sending IP, or SDS cannot change the status to FIXED automatically.

3. Status of bug will be changed to INTEGRATED automatically.
   I run a script every week. The script will make a list of bugs which
   have been fixed in specified period. And I'll give the list to testers.
   They will start to verify our fix without waiting new ISO release.
   But the script cannot take care of some bugs such as new package,
   non-RECEIVED bug before closing IP.
   I'll inform you such bugs. You have to confirm if the fix exists
   and you have to leave a comment immediately. If you delay it, it
   influence testers schedule.

4. At new ISO is going to be released.
   The status of bugs would be INTEGRATED by 3 at new ISO release.
   But developer have to confirm if the ISO includes your fix or not.
   You have to leave a comment on each bugs which you owned to make sure
   about it.

If you don't change the bug status to RECEIVED, you have to do from 2
to 4 by yourself. And it might have impact on the schedule.
So please be careful about it. We have some bugs whose status is still
NEW or REOPENED.

Thanks,
-Jun
