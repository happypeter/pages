== wtec ==
I need to add wtec signup page to axtu-authen-client
FYI, WTEC registraion page.
http://www.wtec.co.th/asianux_registration.html

Better to comfirm with wtec guys before I do the patch

== svn ==
{{{
$svn log 1.4
$svn co $SR/axtu/1.4 -r r5850 // on peter-laptop
$svn co $SR/axtu/1.4 -r 5850 //on romi
}}}

== rpm info ==

rpm source code
{{{
romi: /project/pool/Trinity/ia32/pool/SRPMS/rpm-4.3.3-26_nonptl.1AXS2.src.rpm
}}}
Where to get the lastest rpms  and src_rpms, such as beta4 ones?
{{{
$ssh jupiter
$cd  /project/Quartet/distro/asianux-3.0/iso-images ------lastest iso go here
}}}
later Huajie will copy the lastest ISOs to romi:/project/ISO/
{{{
/project/Quartet/distro/asianux-3.0/src/SRPMS--------------lastest src rpms
}}}

== NOTE ==

when Jun apprival my IP, I need to login SDS  to change it status to "closed".
And after the svn merge, I need close the bugs and check if the change is really integrated in the new ISO, but how?
ANSWER:Wait for the Email from Jun. Check the number "?" in "axtu...-?AX".

 * when you change the IP
  1. check file again to regenerate spec.diff
  1. add postfix to attached img file(like .png)

 * be sure to build the package brfore sending IP
note the name "axtu" or "axtu-authen-client" in
{{{
$sudo  /project/bin/axbldpkg -j Quartet-sp2  -V 3.0  -w ~/sds/ -t /home/peter/tmp/    axtu
}}}
== spcewalk ==

{{{
url:    https://10.1.0.76/rhn/
id:     yuzhu
pwd: abc123
}}}
if you have any question let me know,regards!
== Sent a IP ==
on local machine
{{{
ssh peter@romi
svn co $SR/axtu/1.5      
}}}
on romi 
{{{
[peter@romi axtu]$ ls
1.5
[peter@romi axtu]$ pwd
/home/peter/sds/packages/axtu
}}}
then 
 1. change spec
 1. change source code
 1. choose MT or CurrentDev in sds
 1. compile             
== Axtu Working Copy ==
How to checkout my own working copy

 1. login to rumi

 1. export SR=svn+ssh://peter@10.1.0.96/SDSrepo/trunk/packages/
    
    I already write it into romi;~/.bash_profile

 1. cd romi:/home/peter/sds/packages/

 1. svn co ''$SR/axtu/''  never change the structure, otherwise SDS can not find the code

 1. svn co ''$SR/VERMAP-DIR''

 1. svn co svn+ssh://peter@10.1.0.96/SDSrepo/trunk/comps

    ''romi: /project/bin/axbldpkg'' is the shell script make your source code into a rpm package

 * axtu repo here, but I am not sure if it is the main one???NO

== They way I work ==
go the axtu-debug/ and see what a mess there!!!
I need rules to devide all stuff here into distingushed parts, and yet well keep their connection.

too much disorgnized contents, why is this?

 1. I hate bug-reports, they are always misleading and useless, but here I am now forced to work this way, so I need to mv someaxtu-debug content into bugzilla discussion, and backup my own bugs, and all the sds diff for each IP I sent. How comes I need to backupbugzilla and sds? it's the work of the company, but those guys are not smart enough to keep my data safe.
 1. biggest trouble is from sds&svn, I hate them with all my passion. I can not wirte commit log, how rediculous! But anyway I have git now, so big part of axtu-debug can go into git log and source code comments. comments are really important for me, but I won't commit them into svn. My git repo will be the final authrity for axtu development
 1. I really need to change the way I take debug notes, otherwise things will get undercontrol getting bigger.

>>> some conclutions are really useful for later development, I will copy(maybe mv is better, since it is always stupid to maintain two copy of the same thing) it to doc-axtu/, such as HOW_AXTU_USE_AK and AXTU_GUI_WORK_FLOW, and this also means we do not need peki/study/axtu/ anymore.
