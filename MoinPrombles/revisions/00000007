## page was renamed from MoniPrombles
 

 * how can I delete a file ?
I choose ''action->delete page'', but it is still in
{{{
.../moin-1.8.5/wiki/data/pages
}}}

 * go back to ''FrontPage''?
I definetely need a way to go to the parent-level page, and to homepage with one click
maybe I can just add sth like  FrontPage, haha I don't know

see what I should use? MoinOrMuse?
