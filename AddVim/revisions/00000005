here I want to add vim as the editor for moin

so what is visible in editor is actually in a tmp file, it is only saved to the real page in data/pages/ when
"Save Changes" is clicked.

So now I need to find out where the tmp file is. 
when client side user click "Edit(text)", I just add
{{{
import os
os.system("vim cur_file") #current file means the file opened by Moin's own editor
}}}

I think I can also flash Moin's editor the moment vim quit.
I add
{{{
gggggggg
}}}
to this page, and search in pet's home dir
and found it is in
{{{
./.mozilla/firefox/mkyaxt0x.default/sessionstore.js
}}}
/!\ but this file only contains "ggggggg", everything else is not found.
now it gets difficult.

*** so I just give up finding some tmp file, below I just let vim open the real
current file, and after vim quite, then moin editor will read the modified version of '''current''', this may produce some confusion when moin tries to generate diff, but basically it works.
