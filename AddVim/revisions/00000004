here I want to add vim as the editor for moin

so what is visible in editor is actually in a tmp file, it is only saved to the real page in data/pages/ when
"Save Changes" is clicked.

So now I need to find out where the tmp file is. 
when client side user click "Edit(text)", I just add
{{{
import os
os.system("vim cur_file") #current file means the file opened by Moin's own editor
}}}

I think I can also flash Moin's editor the moment vim quit.
I add
{{{
gggggggg
}}}
to this page, and search in pet's home dir
and found it is in
{{{
./.mozilla/firefox/mkyaxt0x.default/sessionstore.js
}}}
/!\ but this file only contains "ggggggg", everything else is not found.
