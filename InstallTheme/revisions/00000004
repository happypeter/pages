=== install twilight ===
http://github.com/crafterm/twilight-emacs

but this requires ''color-theme'', which used to be a ubuntu package
'''emacs-color-themes'''

but as I checked here

http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/editors/

this package is no longer available in 9.04, must be provided by sth

but I do not know

 * install ''color-theme'' is actually easy:
 1. have ''.emacs'' like this
 {{{
(add-to-list 'load-path "/home/pet/color_theme_peter")
(require 'color-theme)
(color-theme-initialize)
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/twilight-emacs/color-theme-twilight.el")
(color-theme-twilight)
 }}}
 1. natrually, I need this as well
 {{{
pet@girl:~/color_theme_peter$ ls
color-theme.el  themes
pet@girl:~/color_theme_peter$ ls themes/
color-theme-example.el  color-theme-library.el
pet@girl:~/color_theme_peter$ 
 }}}
resart emacs, it works :-)
